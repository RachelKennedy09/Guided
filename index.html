        <h1>About Guided</h1>
        <p>We strive to offer a safe space in which together we can seek deeper connection with
            oneself and explore what you may be seeking, be that reduced suffering, growth, understanding, or healing.
            <br><br>
            Through an emotionally and attachment focused lens, along with utilizing acceptance and commitment and
            psychodynamic therapy tools, we can work with you
            through a traditional psychotherapy framework or with the assistance of psychedelic medicines.
            <br><br>
            We have years of personal and professional experience with psychedelics and are grateful these medicines are
            now becoming
            more accessible as one avenue to help with mental health conditions.

                <h2>Dr. Christine Kennedy, MD, FRCPC Psychiatry</h2>
                <p>Thank you for your curiosity and seeking an avenue of healing that feels aligned with you.
                    <br><br>
                    I am grateful to live an work on the unceded traditional territory of the Lheidli T'enneh Nation. I
                    was raised
                    in the North and am honored to continue to serve and work with people in Northern BC. I am a
                    psychiatrist
                    and in my general practice I offer psychodynamic therapy with a relational approach, focussing on
                    attachment
                    and emotional processing. I also have special interest and training in supporting pregnant and
                    postpartum individuals.
                    <br><br>
                    I am passionate about the use of psychedelics as a way of opening one's heart and mind to what lies
                    beyond their defenses
                    and suffering. Psychedelics can be a psycho spiritual experience and for many people psychedelics
                    have helped them reach
                    deeper parts of themselves. Then with further integration these experiences can lead to true healing
                    and growth in their lives and personal
                    relationships.
                    <br><br>
                    I look forward to seeing if working together in this realm is the right fit at the right time.
